## My Game - Drake Invaders
#### Game Overview 
My game is fundamentally a version of the popular Space Invaders using the characters of producer DJ Khaled as the 'space invader' and rapper Drake as the defender. The game plays on the fact that DJ Khaled is well known in the real world for posting videos to social in which he rants about his tips on being successful in life. Drake is tasked with calming down the DJ during one of these rants. The aim is to rid the gameboard of DJ Khaleds by throwing stacks of money at him while avoiding the enemy missiles - 'major keys'. The game is won when all of the Khaleds have been subdued; it is otherwise lost if Drake is hit by a key three times or Khaled encroaches on his space.
